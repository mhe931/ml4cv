        "**Object Detection** is a computer vision technique that works to identify and locate objects within an image or video. Specifically, object detection draws bounding boxes around these detected objects, which allow us to locate where said objects are in (or how they move through) a given scene.\n",
        "\n",
        "**YOLO (You Only Look Once)** is a family of object detection models known for their speed and efficiency. Unlike two-stage detectors (like R-CNN) that first generate region proposals and then classify them, YOLO processes the image in a single pass, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images. This makes it extremely fast and suitable for real-time applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "**YOLOv2 Tiny** is a lightweight version of YOLOv2 optimized for speed and to run on devices with lower computational power. It uses the **Darknet** architecture as its backbone feature extractor.\n",
        "\n",
        "### A Note on Transposed Convolutions\n",
        "While YOLOv2 relies heavily on downsampling (pooling/strided convolutions) to aggregate features, modern architectures (like GANs or Semantic Segmentation networks like U-Net) often need to **upsample** lower-resolution feature maps back to the original image size. **Transposed Convolutions** (sometimes incorrectly called de-convolutions) are a learnable way to perform this upsampling, essentially reversing the spatial effect of a standard convolution.\n",
